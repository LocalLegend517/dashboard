# GrowlManager

GrowlManager component is used to display (async) responses of specific actions as a overlay. Each message is represented severity, summary, and details.

### When to use it

* To provide real-time information to the User about out-of-view events or background processes.
* To display a message to appear and have the User take action to dismiss.
* To display non-critical information that wonâ€™t disrupt a workflow.


### When not to use it
* For error messages related to a specific form fields.
* For messages are related to a specific component or view (use inline alerts instead).

### Usage

We can display different leves of messages in the GrowlManager component by dispatching actions to the `growl` store.


#### Info (default)
For events of lower relative importance, or for generic use.

```ts
this.$store.dispatch('growl/info', {
    title:   'Info',
    message: 'This is an info message',
  }, { root: true });
```

#### Success
For reporting of a successful end of an operation or action.

```ts
this.$store.dispatch('growl/success', {
    title:   'Success',
    message: 'This is an success message',
  }, { root: true });
```

#### Warning
For events that require user attention.
```ts
this.$store.dispatch('growl/warning', {
    title:   'Warning',
    message: 'This is an warning message',
  }, { root: true });
```

#### Error
When things go wrong.

For events that require user attention.
```ts
this.$store.dispatch('growl/error', {
    title:   'Error',
    message: 'This is an error message',
  }, { root: true });
```
